name: ${ID}-data
description: How to retrieve real ${TITLE} values from the cited local snapshot. Use BEFORE answering ANY ${TITLE} question naming an entity matching ${ID_FIELD}, a release/catalog, or a superlative. Trigger on the bare question, not only inside a command, so the answer comes from the provenance-stamped cache. Tier ${TIER}.

# ${TITLE} data access (tier ${TIER})

Cache first — the only fast retrieval path. The snapshot ships at `${CACHE_PATH}`.
It is retrieved data with provenance, not recalled values.

```bash
python lib/pcache.py entity <id> --cache ${CACHE_PATH}
python lib/pcache.py max <param> --cache ${CACHE_PATH}     # superlative (scope ${CUMULATIVE_SCOPE})
python lib/pcache.py meta --cache ${CACHE_PATH}
```

Report `best` + asymmetric error + unit, the DOI, the provenance string, the
snapshot `retrieved_utc`, and the scope. Superlatives resolve against
`${CUMULATIVE_SCOPE}`; report the scope explicitly. ${SCOPE_TRAP}

Tier note: LIVE -> a cache miss may fall back to exactly one live fetch;
REDERIVE/ASSERTED -> a cache miss is an honest absence, never a recall.
